# Baked Camembert with balsamic caramelised onions

_**50min**_

### Ingredients

- 2 red onions
- 1 fully wooden boxed camembert
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 sprig fresh rosemary
- generous glug white wine
- 1 tablespoon butter
- generous glug balsamic vinegar
- some salt and black pepper to taste
- 1 loaf fresh baked Mediterranean bread (shop bought is fine)

### Method

1. Preheat the oven to 200 C / Gas 6. Chop onions into large chunks.
2. Unwrap Camembert and make incisions into the rind on both sides.
3. Slice a garlic clove into small slivers and strip the rosemary sprig of its leaves.
4. Push the garlic slivers and rosemary into the holes in the cheese, on both sides. You can use the blunt end of a fork or a chopstick to push them right inside.
5. Run the empty Camembert box under cold water until it is saturated. Then place the foil covered cheese inside the half of the box and place it onto a baking tray.
6. Wrap the Camembert tightly in foil, leaving the top loosely open. Pour some white wine over the top of the cheese and then loosely close the foil over the cheese.
7. Place into the preheated hot oven.
8. Heat some butter in a hot pan. Add the red onions. Keep the onions on a medium heat, stirring constantly, adding more butter if required, until onions wilt down and go sticky.
9. When the onions go sticky, add a glug of balsamic vinegar and add salt and pepper to taste.
10. The onions will be ready when the balsamic vinegar has reduced. Keep it on a low heat, stirring occasionally.
11. Check the cheese. It is ready when it is starting to go really gooey and there is no hardness inside the cheese when you put a knife in.
12. Take the shop-bought, fresh loaf, run it briefly under a cold tap and place in oven, directly on a shelf, the water means that the loaf will warm up without burning or crisping up. The loaf is ready when it is warm all over and not damp!
13. Serve the Camembert in its foil, so it stays gooey for longer, with chunks of the warm bread and dollops of balsamic onions.
