# Eggs cocotte with prosciutto

_**15min**_

### Ingredients

- 2 knobs butter
- 4 thin slices prosciutto, chopped
- 2 eggs
- 2 pinches ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons double cream
- 2 sprigs fresh parsley, chopped

### Method

1. Preheat oven to 200 C / Gas 6 and grease 2 ramekins with a knob of butter each.
2. Divide prosciutto evenly between each ramekin, then break an egg into each (taking care not to damage the yolk). Season with pepper and bake in preheated oven for 6 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, heat cream for a few moments in the microwave.
3. Remove from oven, drizzle each with warm cream and top with chopped parsley. Serve hot.
