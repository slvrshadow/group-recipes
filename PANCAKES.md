# PANCAKES

## INGREDIENTS

- 250ml cake flour

Sift the flour, sugar and salt together. Whisk the eggs and milk together. Gradually whisk the flour mixture into the egg mixture until smooth. Allow to stand for 20 minutes.
Heat a lightly greased 22cm round pan on low. Add 60ml of the batter and swirl to cover the base of the pan. Cook for about 2-3 minutes, then flip and cook for about 1 minute until just cooked. Place on a piece of baking paper and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining batter.
